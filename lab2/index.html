			<h1>Lab 2 - HTML and CSS</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab is to experiment with HTML and stylize our lab with a CSS file using a text editor. I used VSCode for this lab. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems I had included linking my CSS file properly and including a photo in my lab as well as adjusting the dimensions of the photo in css. By revisiting the assignment instructions and going to instructor office hours, I was able to solve these problems. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I found this lab to be really challenging at first. After struggling to understand, going to office hours, redoing the lab, forgetting to resubmit the lab, and eventually remembering to resubmit the lab, I am proud to turn this in.  </p>
