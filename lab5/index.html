			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types & Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The objective of this lab was creating and printing variables on the console. Then, we used the Javascript document.writeln to check if the variables would stick and print.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I did need to ask my lab partner Sean clarifying questions about how to write a boolean variable. I also had problems with implementing the CSS file and inseting an image, 
						which are skills from Lab 2. I've been procrastinating/getting frustrated with Lab 2 related tasks so I will be paying an office hours visit soon to get it figured out! 
					I also ran into some problems uploading my Github page as I have two different Github accounts, and these were out of sync with my VSCode account.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I did this lab slowly but surely. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Here is my script output as well as a picture of my beloved e-bike. </p>

						<script type= "text/javascript" src= "js/lab.js"></script>
