                <h2> Challenge </h2>
                <p> For this lab, the goal is to learn how to recreate the lab file structures for the remainder of our class. 
                    From there, our goal is to create a function that take the user's name as an imput, and returns it "sorted".</p>

                <h2> Problems </h2>
                <p> I had issue with my function. When I ran it, I did not get a window popup, and will have to revisit this.
                    In other problems like creating the files and folders, I was able to learn with the help of my awesome lab partner. Sean.
