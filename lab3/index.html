					<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure</h1>
					<div class="minor-section">
							<h2>Challenge</h2>
							<p>The goal of this lab is to design a homepage for ourselves and learn how to upload sites to the Github server. </p>
					</div>
		
					<div class="minor-section">
							<h2>Problems</h2>
							<p> The biggest challenge of this lab was figuring out how to upload our site onto Github.  </p>
					</div>
		
					<div class="minor-section">
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>I think that not doing this lab correctly the first time was really a setback because uploading to Github is a skill repeated in every lab. It was a comment that I would get from Ilia in feedback from other labs that I wasn't properly uploading to Github! Back to the basics. </p>
